I'm a software engineer passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence in improving reliability, scalability, and performance of core mobile-first systems. I have a background in Mathematics and Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Georgia Institute of Technology. I envision myself leading business, design, and engineering teams around large-scale critical infrastructure in the future. In addition to this, I also have great interest in getting my feet wet in the field of venture capital or private equity; specializing in seed, early stage, and growth investments in the next-generation of infrastructure-related companies. Currently, I work as part of the infrastructure team at [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com/), a mobile games company, in the San Francisco Bay Area.
